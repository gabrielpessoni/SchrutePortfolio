            <p>Dwight was born on January 20, 1968, and claims to remember his birth, including his father delivering him, and his mother biting of his umbilical cord. He also claims to have had a twin, that was "reabsorbed" while still in the womb, causing him to believe he has "the strength of a grown man and a little baby." <br><br>
                “I am a salesman and the assistant (to the) regional manager at the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin before my promotion to regional manager. I also run a bed and breakfast at Schrute Farms, a beet plantation owner, and the owner of the business park in which Dunder Mifflin Scranton is located.”</p>
